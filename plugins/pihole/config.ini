# http, ssh, or telnet
# telnet only works if PiDisplay is running on the same system as Pi-Hole.
# ssh only works if you set up your pi-hole as an ssh server and set up an authorized key so you can log into your
#    pi-hole without a password. This is will log into the pi-hole and run the same telnet commands that would run if
#    this is set to "telnet", only now you can do it from another raspberry pi that is running PiDisplay.
# http only works if you have the FTL web api running and have generated an api_key on your pi-hole.

# Basically, if you are running PiDisplay on your Pi-Hole box then use telnet.  If not, then set up SSH keys authentication
#    and use that.  If you can't do that, then se http.  The HTTP interface is not very well documented and doesn't have
#    all the same features as the telnet version.

# Note that at the time of this writing, FTL does not support getting more than one recently-blocked domain.  I
#    submitted a fix but until they approve it the "http" api will not get all info. This is only impactful if you choose
#    "http" for an api.

# Add new clocks by adding clock#_label and clock#_timezone configuration entries like:
# clock2_label = Home
# clock2_timezone = US/Pacific
# clock3_label = Denver, CO
# clock3_timezone = US/Mountain

# At the time of this writing, the timezone must be one of the timezones in the timezones.txt. Consult that file for the proper formatting.
# Really though, the timezone just must be recognized by the pytx python module.  To get an up to date list of timezones,
#    open the python interpreter by running "python3" at the commandline and then running:
#
# import pytz
# for i in pytz.all_timezones: print(i)
#
# Note: you must specify a label entry but it can be empty if you don't want one, like:
# clock2_label =
# clock2_timezone = PST

clock1_label = Los Angeles
clock1_timezone = US/Pacific
